## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Discord Bot Token
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`

2. Fill in your Discord bot credentials:

```env
TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
APP_ID=your_app_id
PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id

PG_DATABASE=your-database
PG_HOST=your-host
PG_USER=your-user
PG_PASSWORD=your-password
PG_PORT=your-port
```


**Step by Step:**

1. Register Discord commands:

```bash
pnpm run register
```

2. Start all services:

```bash
pnpm run docker:up
```

3. View logs:

```bash
pnpm run docker:logs
```

### Useful Commands

```bash
# Stop all services
pnpm run docker:down

# Restart everything
pnpm run docker:rebuild

```

### Database

The bot uses PostgreSQL with the following schema:

- **tasks**: Main table storing all tasks with hierarchical relationships
- **Indexes**: Optimized for guild_id, user_id, parent_id, and status queries
- **Triggers**: Automatic timestamp updates

### Channel Notifications

Configure `CHANNEL_ID` in your `.env` to receive automatic notifications with progress overviews when:

- Tasks are created
- Tasks are accepted/started
- Tasks are completed
- Tasks are closed

### Task Status Behavior

- **Active tasks**: Created, Doing, and Done tasks appear in normal lists
- **Closed tasks**: Hidden from normal views, only visible when specifically filtered
- **Progress calculation**: Only "Done" tasks count as 100% complete; all others show 0%

### Progress Calculation

- **Leaf tasks**: Progress based on status (Created: 0%, Doing: 0%, Done: 100%, Closed: 0%)
- **Parent tasks**: Progress calculated from completed subtasks percentage
- **Visual indicators**: Progress bars and status emojis for quick overview
- **Real-time notifications**: Channel notifications include overall progress overview

## Development

### Project Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ commands/           # Command handlers
â”œâ”€â”€ database/          # Database connection and migrations
â”œâ”€â”€ models/            # TypeScript interfaces
â”œâ”€â”€ services/          # Business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/             # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts           # Main bot file
â””â”€â”€ register.ts        # Command registration
```

### Adding New Commands

1. Add command definition to `register.ts`
2. Create handler method in `TaskCommandHandler.ts`
3. Add case to interaction handler in `index.ts`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database connection failed**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and credentials are correct
2. **Commands not appearing**: Re-run the register script and wait a few minutes
3. **Permission errors**: Ensure bot has necessary permissions in your Discord server

### Logs

Check Docker logs for database issues:
```bash
docker-compose logs postgres
docker-compose logs ts-service
```
